# Password Generator

This page and its associated stylings were provided in the starter code which can be found <a href="https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet">here</a>.

This is an introductory javascript exercise. When the button to generate a password is clicked, the user is prompted to decide how long they would like their password to be, and which types of characters they would like their password to contain. Questions and text are presented to the user through the window object in the form of alerts, confirms, and prompts. Once the user has answered all of the questions, the randomly generated password is displayed on the page and in the console.

Deployed site is viewable <a href="https://michael-rodriguez22.github.io/JAVASCRIPT-CHALLENGE-password-generator/">here</a>. Enjoy!
