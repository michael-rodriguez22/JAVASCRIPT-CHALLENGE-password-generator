# Password Generator

For this challenge, I was tasked with creating an simple random password generator. The page and its associated stylings were provided in the starter code which can be found <a href="https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet">here</a>.

This is an introductory javascript exercise, therefore creating a smooth UX was beyond the scope of this challenge. When the button to generate a password is clicked, the user is then prompted to answer a set of questions regarding which characters they would like to allow in their password, and how long they would like their password to be. Once the user has answered all of the questions, the randomly generated password is displayed.

The deployed site is viewable by clicking on the image below.
